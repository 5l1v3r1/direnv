direnv - Unclutter your .profile
================================

direnv allows you to have path-dependent environment variables. It works in combination with your shell (bash or zsh) to make the magic work.

Example
-------

    $ cd ~/code/my_project
    $ ls
    bin/ lib/ Rakefile README.md
    $ echo $PATH
    /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
    $ echo PATH_add bin > .envrc
    direnv: loading /Users/zimbatm/code/my_project
    $ echo $PATH
    /Users/zimbatm/code/my_project/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
    $ cd ..
    direnv: unloading /Users/zimbatm/code/my_project
    $ echo $PATH
    /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

Install
-------

1a) Get the code and put direnv in your path

    git clone http://github.com/zimbatm/shell-env
    ln -s `pwd`/direnv/bin /usr/local/bin/direnv

1b) Use homebrew (for OSX users)

    brew install direnv

2) Add this line at the end of your .bashrc (after rvm, git-prompt, ...):

    eval `direnv hook $0`


Note that zsh's "named directory" feature will replace %c in your PROMPT with "~DIRENV_DIR". Until I find a solution, use %C instead if it annoys you.
