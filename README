Setups a shell environment depending on your path


Inspirations
------------

Homebrew, RVM


Q: How does RVM update the ENV when changing path?
A: It overrides cd with :

cd() {
  builtin cd "$@"
  local result=$?
  __rvm_project_rvmrc
  rvm_hook="after_cd" ; source "$rvm_path/scripts/hook"
  return $result
}

It does not work in any cases because cd is not the only command to change
directory. (see: pushd for example)

Q: How does the magic work ?
A: We set the PROMPT_COMMAND to a function name
  On each promt display, the function is called, adapting the environment
  depending on the path.
